	<h1>Self Reflection</h1>
		<p>
			As I sit here in my room as I've done for a majority of my life, </br>
			I've sat and waited for things to happen to me. </br>
			It's hard to find the motivation when so many things you try fail to meet </br>
			your inner critic's judgement of where <strong>you should be at</strong>. </br>
			But just keep doing your best, trying with all your might until eventually, </br>
			you will get to where you want to be.
